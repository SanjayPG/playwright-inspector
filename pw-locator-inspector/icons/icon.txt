To generate the required PNG icon files:

METHOD 1 - Using the HTML Generator (Recommended):
1. Open generate-icons.html in your web browser
2. Icons will auto-generate
3. Click "Download" for each size (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
4. Save them as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png in this icons/ folder

METHOD 2 - Using any image editor:
Create 3 PNG files with these specifications:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Design: Purple gradient background with ðŸŽ­ theater masks emoji

METHOD 3 - Quick placeholder (temporary):
Use any solid color square PNG images with the correct sizes.
The extension will work, just without nice icons.

Once you have the PNG files, the extension will be ready to load in Chrome!
